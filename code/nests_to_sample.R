#' nests_to_sample
#' 
#' \code{nests_to_sample} Samples nests across a whole breeding season to 
#'    determine if all of the males that contributed were identified. 
#'
#' @param n_sims integer value, the number of simulations to run. Default value 
#'    is 1e6.
#' @param pop_size integer value, the population size of all breeding adults. 
#'    Default value is 100.
#' @param sample_size integer value, the sample size to collect. Default value 
#'    is 32. .
#' @param fertilization_mode a character value defining the distribution of 
#'    male contributions to fertilizing a single nest. Potential values 
#'    include random', 'exponential', dominant50', 'dominant70', 
#'    'dominant90', 'mixed_dominant'). Default value is 'random'.
#' @param Mprob a numeric vector, the probabilities of females mating with 1+ 
#'    males. 
#' @param Fprob a numeric vector, the probabilities of males mating with 1+ 
#'    females.
#' @param nests_mu an integer value, the mean number of nests a female lays in 
#'    one nesting season. Default value is 4.95. 
#' @param nests_sd an integer value, the standard deviation of the number of 
#'    nests a female lays in one nesting season. Default value is 2.09. 
#' @param id_probs a dataframe with columns "Fertilization Mode", 
#'    "Males" (number of contributing males), "Sample Size" (1 - 96), 
#'    "Proportion Correct" (how many simulations correctly identified all males), 
#'    and "Marginal" (the marginal fertilization contributions of the last male).
